# HFT Arbitrage Bot

A high-frequency trading arbitrage bot that monitors multiple cryptocurrency exchanges simultaneously to identify and alert on arbitrage opportunities.

## Features

- **Multi-Exchange Monitoring**: Simultaneously monitors Binance, Kraken, and OKX
- **Real-time Price Feeds**: Uses WebSocket connections for low-latency price updates
- **Arbitrage Detection**: Automatically identifies profitable arbitrage opportunities
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Set minimum spread percentages for arbitrage alerts
- **Thread-Safe**: Concurrent processing with proper synchronization

## Architecture

```
hft-arbitrage-bot/
â”œâ”€â”€ exchange/          # Exchange-specific WebSocket implementations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ binance.go     # Binance BTC/USDT price feed
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ kraken.go      # Kraken XBT/USD price feed
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ okx.go         # OKX BTC-USDT price feed
â”œâ”€â”€ strategy/          # Arbitrage strategy implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ arbitrage.go   # Main arbitrage detection logic
â””â”€â”€ main.go           # Application entry point and coordination
```

## How It Works

1. **Exchange Connections**: Each exchange runs in its own goroutine, maintaining WebSocket connections
2. **Quote Aggregation**: All price quotes are sent to a central channel
3. **Arbitrage Analysis**: The strategy continuously analyzes quotes from all exchanges
4. **Opportunity Detection**: When profitable spreads are found, alerts are generated

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hft-arbitrage-bot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Build the application:
```bash
go build -o hft-bot .
```

## Usage

Run the arbitrage bot:
```bash
./hft-bot
```

The bot will:
- Connect to all three exchanges (Binance, Kraken, OKX)
- Start monitoring BTC price feeds
- Display real-time price updates
- Alert when arbitrage opportunities are found

Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully shutdown the bot.

## Configuration

### Minimum Spread Threshold

The bot is configured with a 0.1% minimum spread threshold by default. This means arbitrage opportunities will only be reported if the potential profit is at least 0.1% of the purchase price.

To modify this threshold, edit the `main.go` file:

```go
// Create arbitrage strategy with 0.1% minimum spread
arbitrageStrategy := strategy.NewArbitrageStrategy(0.1) // Change this value
```

### Supported Trading Pairs

Currently, the bot monitors:
- **Binance**: BTC/USDT
- **Kraken**: XBT/USD  
- **OKX**: BTC-USDT

## Technical Details

### Concurrency Model

- Each exchange runs in its own goroutine
- Quotes are sent through a buffered channel (capacity: 1000)
- The arbitrage strategy processes quotes every 100ms
- Thread-safe quote storage with read-write mutex

### Error Handling

- Graceful WebSocket reconnection handling
- Channel overflow protection
- Invalid data filtering
- Graceful shutdown on interrupt signals

### Performance Considerations

- Non-blocking quote transmission
- Efficient arbitrage calculation algorithm
- Minimal memory allocation in hot paths
- Configurable update frequency
